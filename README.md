We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in this community are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.  
To make clear what is expected, everyone actively participating in the [iastro-pt](https://github.com/iastro-pt) organization is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. This code of conduct applies within the GitHub organization including, but not limited to, all the repositories owned by the organization and all activities happening online or offline that are linked to the organization.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that you report it by emailing `report-iastro-pt` at `protonmail.com`. All reports will be kept confidential and all reports will be reviewed.

## Code of Conduct

The [iastro-pt](https://github.com/iastro-pt) organization is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.  We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor.

Harassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:

  - written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of the characteristics listed above
  - causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
  - the display of sexual or violent images
  - unwelcome sexual attention
  - sustained disruption of communication
  - incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
  - continuing to initiate interaction with someone after being asked to stop
  - publication of private communication without consent
  
Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to both.  
Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all members.
